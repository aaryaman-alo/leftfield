            Leftfield is an expert in supporting businesses who are looking to grow their exports by expanding into new markets. Leftfield offers a range of services that are tailored to meet the needs and objectives of the client.

          <p className="text-xl">
            Leftfield develops customized Go-To-Market strategies that are specific to a client company, its products and the targeted export market. We review and evaluate all of the existing product and market information, along with additional market research if necessary, to determine which markets provide the greatest opportunity for that client. We then develop and optimize a Go-To-Market strategy specific to the strengths and positioning of that client&apos;s products in the selected market.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-xl">
            Leftfield also works with clients to enhance their capacity to successfully execute a market expansion by working very closely with their executive teams to manage the new relationships and develop any additional competencies required for the new market. We can also help the client refine their offering and assist with raising additional capital that may be needed to support such growth.

            Leftfield works with businesses to help them expand in their existing markets and grow into new markets. By working with Leftfield, our clients can enter new markets with less risk and lower investment than if they were to do so by themselves.
          </p>

          <p className="text-xl">
            Leftfield helps businesses establish strategic partners in a given market. These can include distributors with existing sales channels that can help our client quickly drive sales volume. They can also include manufacturing partners who act as contract manufacturers to locally produce a client&apos;s products.
          </p>
          
          <p className="text-xl">
            Leftfield also works very closely with clients to help win those important first wins and signature customers in their target markets. These marquee customers help validate the client&apos;s products in that regional market. We then help the client build upon these initial customer successes by developing ongoing strategic sales initiatives that can deliver significant revenues quickly.
